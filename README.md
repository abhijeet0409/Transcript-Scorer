# Transcript Scorer – README

## 📝 Overview

Transcript Scorer is an AI-powered tool that evaluates transcripts based on multiple qualitative and structural parameters. Whether you upload a transcript file or paste your text directly, the system analyzes it and provides detailed scoring and insights.

This tool is useful for:

* Interview analysis
* Academic transcript evaluation
* Meeting or lecture summarization quality checks
* Content structure and clarity evaluation

## 🚀 Features

* **Multi-parameter Scoring**: Structure, clarity, grammar, coherence, tone, accuracy, depth, and more.
* **AI-powered Analysis**: Built-in AI processes text and generates a high-level as well as detailed evaluation.
* **Flexible Input Options**:

  * Upload a transcript file (PDF, TXT, DOCX, etc.)
  * Type or paste the transcript directly into the text editor
* **Insightful Summary & Suggestions**: Get actionable feedback for improvement.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. **Provide the Transcript**

You can choose one of the following:

* **Upload a file** containing your transcript.
* **Paste or write** your transcript in the input area.

### 2. **AI Processing**

Once the inputs are provided:

* The system extracts text (if a file is uploaded)
* Cleans, formats, and tokenizes the transcript
* The built-in AI then evaluates the transcript across defined parameters

### 3. **Scoring & Output**

The system generates:

* **Parameter-wise score breakdown**
* **Strengths and weaknesses**
* **Accuracy and coherence analysis**
* **Improvement suggestions**
* **Overall score** out of 100
